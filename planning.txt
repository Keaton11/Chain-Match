PLAN:
-Users enter tournament and add money on the line (smart contract) - smart contract resolves when it knows the winner
Play game outside of platform
-Both users enter the scores on platform

When does the chain know the winner:
If consistent results: immediately fill smart contract, giving money to winner, winner can then go to next match or leave and take winnings
If inconsistent results: moderator needs to intervene - then tell platform the winner (also add negative consequence for user that lied or left)

-Winner then continues to next bracket or leaves with cash, loser can reenter tournament




COMPONENTS:
Blockchain Smart Contracts
Rust? interacting between user and blockchain (making smart contracts)
React UI
Commmunication between user and server
Server




PARTS:
Com - User pings server saying they want to enter match
Ser - Server receives messages, decide matchmaking, then send to users who is in match
Com - User receives match
Com - User makes smart contract with Chain
Com/UI - Some confirmation happens that both users agreed and displays to user
----outside game happens----
UI - Users input scores
Com - User sends data to blockchain
Blo/Com - block chain transfers money OR has error and contacts admin
    Some way for admin to reconfirm and have consequence for person who caused error
UI/Com - user can go to next match or leave, tell server if next match

POSSIBILITIES FOR ADDITION:
Equal Matches (possibility that winner streak goes against new person, just change price amounts)
Ranking so people face people with similar strength
Could add low risk & high risk games that have different starting wagers
Forfeit Feature
optimize servers search algorithm
Way for people to set up their own server to set up their own config
    can also add incentive to 




CHEATING ISSUE
Deposit, if descrepincy, then both players lose money and Deposit
    money gets stored in blockchain (gets lost to time, if someone gets it it gives incentive for them to screw up the system)


Possibility to add reputation thing so that there's a benefit to continue with the same wallet (and then if people commonly cause discrepencies bad stuff happens)
    Can also degrade over time, can do seasonal stuff as well so more recent games have more weight






SMART CONTRACT
Continuous:
Keeps track of active matches

Execute: 
Make matches (both people make matches that get connected to one match) - they say what level they are at?
Confirm Scores (only once both have confirmed does the smart contract send out money)
    If long time passes it should be considered Forfeit
